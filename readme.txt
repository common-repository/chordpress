Lewe ChordPress for WordPress pretty-prints ChordPro formatted text and chord diagrams on your pages or posts.

== Description ==
Lewe ChordPress pretty-prints ChordPro formatted text files on your pages and posts. You can configure output and formatting options. With 'interactive' mode on, you can transpose the chords up and down and also print the output right from the page.

Lewe ChordPress supports [SVGuitar](https://github.com/omnibrain/svguitar "SVGuitar chord renderer") for visual chord representation.

Your input to Lewe ChordPress needs to be a valid ChordPro formatted text. ChordPro is a simple text-based syntax used to write lead sheets, the lyrics and chords of a song. ChordPro also comes with a command line tool that pretty prints that text into other formats like PDF.
You can read all about ChordPro here:
[ChordPro](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/ChordPro-File-Format-Specification.html "ChordPro file format specification")

The Lewe ChordPress plugin allows to put ChordPro text inside its shortcode tags on a page or post and will pretty print it when the web page is displayed.

Simply insert a ChordPro text inbetween the [chordpress] and [/chordpress] tags and it will be rendered based on the default options of the plugin. You can change output and formatting settings on the plugin's admin page.

A TinyMCE editor integration is also included, providing an editor menu button to insert the shortcode for you with its default paramaters, e.g. wrapping it around selected text.

The `[chordpress]` shortag allows specifying custom options for rendering ChordPro texts. For example:

1. `[chordpress transpose="1"]` will transpose the chords rendered by one semitone.
2. `[chordpress interactive="yes"]` will allow you to transpose the chords up and down and also print the output right from the rendered page.

Check out this example:
[Lewe ChordPress Demo](https://sayandsound.lewe.com/heart-of-gold/ "Lewe ChordPress Demo")

The `[chordpress-chord]` shortag allows you to display a guitar chord as a diagram. For example:

1. `[chordpress-chord chord="112"]` will show the guitar chord post with ID 112 as a diagram.
2. `[chordpress-chord barre="5,1,1" fingers="(3,2,'2'),(4,3,'4'),(5,3,'3')" title="F# Major" tuning="E,A,D,G,H,E"]` will show a custom guitar chord.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why are empty ChordPro lines not rendered ? =
Empty lines are stripped from shortcode content and are not passed to the plugin. A good way to work around that is to use the {start_of_verse}/{start_of_chorus} tags and give them a top/bottom margin on the options page.
= What is the H/B notation ? =
The H/B notation uses H instead of B and B is used insetad of Bb. This notation is used in some European countries. Read more about it here: [H/BN Notation](https://sayandsound.lewe.com/note-h/ "H/B Notation").
